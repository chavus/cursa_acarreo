# Cursa Acarreo

An application to track and manage construction materials shipping.

*Application UI is in Spanish since it is developed for a client in MÃ©xico. Code is all in English.*

## Application functionality

The application is divided in 2 main parts: the administration panel and the operators' application.

- Adminsitration panel: Only accessed by users with admin role. Here admins can visualize all the shippings that are in progress and finalized. Also, admins can create new users, material banks, projects, drivers and trucks.
